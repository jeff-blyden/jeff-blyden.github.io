        Bar Buddies is a non-profit organization based in Belleville, IL, and was founded on the belief that
        education should not be hindered by hunger. Our organization directly partners with local bars, restaurants,
        and shoppes to organize fundraising events that bring the community together and raise money to eradicate school
        lunch debt. With our passion for making a positive impact in the community, we work tirelessly towards making
        a meaningful difference in the lives of local families.
